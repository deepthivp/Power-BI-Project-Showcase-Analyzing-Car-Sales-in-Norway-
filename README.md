# Power-BI-Project-Showcase-Analyzing-Car-Sales-in-Norway-

I'm excited to share my recent Power BI project, where I delved into the dynamic world of car sales in Norway. Leveraging the Car Sales of Norway Dataset, I used Microsoft Power BI to extract valuable insights from the data. Here's a glimpse into the project's highlights:

Data Operations:
✅ Data Gathering
✅ Data Cleaning
✅ Data Transformation
✅ Data Visualization
✅ Sharing Insights

Key Questions & Insights:

Display the units sold for each car brand.
How much revenue was generated for each car model?
Can you display the number of variants available for each car model?
What is the market value for each car brand? Show with the help of a BAR chart.
Display the top 5 models (variants) for each brand based on revenue generated.
Show the market share percentage of brands.
Show the trend of sales over time for each car model.
Data Transformation & Model:
I transformed the data using Power Query and connected it to Power BI, creating a Star Schema Model with three tables joined with One to Many Relationships for in-depth analysis.

Key Insights:

Volkswagen commands the highest market share.
Volkswagen’s Golf and Tiguan, Ford’s Fiesta and Focus, and BMW’s 3 Series are the top-performing models.
Sales trends remained stable from 2010 to 2016 but saw a sharp decline afterward due to various economic and environmental factors.

Feel free to explore the interactive dashboard I created to visualize these insights in detail.
